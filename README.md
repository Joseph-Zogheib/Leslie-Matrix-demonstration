After resolving the issue regarding AP Chemistry, Mr. Palladinetti has congratulated you for your outstanding work. However, you are not finished just yet. He has instructed you to assist the students in AP Environmental Science with their studies.
Currently, they are working on Unit 2 and are struggling with species and population growth. To help them, their teacher is using the simple mayfly as an example in a simulated environment. Use your math background to assist in this demonstration.
The species of mayfly being examined has a lifecycle lasting for at most a week. We can divide female mayflies into four age groups of varying lengths each: eggs (0-3 days), nymphs (3-5 days), subimagines (5-6 days), and imagines (6-7 days). The eggs, along with the nymphs and subimagines, do not lay eggs, while each imago can lay an average of 100 eggs. The survival rate for an egg is 12.5%. The survival rate for a nymph is 6.25%, and the survival rate for a subimago is 99%.
Assume the initial population features 10,000 imagines, 1,000 subimagines, 9,000 eggs, and 8,000 nymphs, each with a uniform survival probability and population distribution for each day. Predict the mayfly population for each of the next 10 years.
